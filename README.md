EE19B018

**Previous Experience:**

- Embedded Systems Intern - GalaxEye
- Business Member - Team Arihant, IITM
- Associate - Case Club

**Current PORs:**
NONE

**Why I want to work in the team:**

- Being part of the team, I have the opportunity to learn a lot of new stuff, from both software and other divisions as well. I started to explore and focus more on CS recently and I think I would be learning a lot with the team as I think there would be numerous discussions and exchange of knowledge and ideas, which honestly seems a lot more fun than to do something alone.
- Infact just by making this application, I learnt basic ROS and OpenCV, so I am sure there would be a lot of learning being part of the team.
- To win the IGCV Competition :)
